## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have completed:

1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
   - Worked with a highly imbalanced and large dataset for classifying credit card transactions as fraudulent and nonfraudulent. Performed extensive data preprocessing, data balancing and training of an ML model. Obtained an accuracy of 99.999% and achieved ‘0’ false negatives. Further, used Apache Spark to reduce training time.


2. **Brain Tumor Detection**
   - Proposed three methods to detect Brain tumors from MRI scans. The first method involved detecting brain tumors using image processing alone. This included the following: pre-processing, filtering, image segmentation, and morphological operations. The second and third methods involved using Gaussian Blur and Canny Edge Detection
techniques, followed by training on CNN.

3. **Prediction of Dengue Fever**
   - Performed data cleaning, hyperparameter optimization, and feature selection, then trained the model. Found that Dengue Fever Count cannot be predicted accurately based on climatic factors alone. The other factors influencing dengue spread are studied.
