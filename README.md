## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have completed:

1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
   - Worked with a highly imbalanced and large dataset for classifying credit card transactions as fraudulent and non-fraudulent. Performed extensive data preprocessing, data balancing and training of an ML model. Obtained an accuracy of 99.999% and achieved ‘0’ false negatives. Further, used Apache Spark to reduce training time.


2. **Brain Tumor Detection**
   - Proposed three methods to detect Brain tumors from MRI scans. The first method involved detecting brain tumors using image processing alone. This included the following: pre-processing, filtering, image segmentation, and morphological operations. The second and third methods involved using Gaussian Blur and Canny Edge Detection
techniques, followed by training on CNN.

3. **Prediction of Dengue Fever**
   - Performed data cleaning, hyperparameter optimization, and feature selection, then trained the model. Found that Dengue Fever Count cannot be predicted accurately based on climatic factors alone. The other factors influencing dengue spread are studied.

4. **Detection of Lung Diseases using Deep Learning**
   - The dataset comprises lung X-ray images categorized into 15 classes, encompassing 14 different diseases, along with a label indicating no pathological findings.
  
5. **Leaf Disease Detection**
   - The PlantVillage dataset is used to classify leaf images into healthy and diseased. Convolutional Neural Networks is used for training and classification of these images.

6. **Employees Database using SQL**
   - Employees database consists of 6 tables namely, employees, dept_manager, departments, titles, salaries, and dept_emp. Queries are written using SQL to extract the necessary information.

7. **Bank Customers Analysis using Tableau**
   -  The customers' data is visualized using Tableau. This analysis provides insights about how customers having different jobs, belonging to various age groups and gender are spread across regions. This helps in converting more customers by reaching the right set of people.

8. **Analyzing Customer Churn using Power BI**
   - Retaining existing customers is typically more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Therefore, reducing churn is a priority for many companies. In this project, reasons for customer churn are analyzed using Power BI.
